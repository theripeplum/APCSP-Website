		  <center><h1>My partner and I decided to make a pizza maker. We added choices for toppings that people can use. If there is a certain topping that you don't like, you can always choose "no." The worker is a bit sassy, though, so if you say anything other than yes or no, he may give you lip. Overall, it's a python recreation of everyone's favorite food: pizza.</h1></center>

		  <center><h1>My partners and I decided to make an interactive two player game. In this game, Spongebob and Patrick are able to shoot fireballs. This code detects for when fireballs, which are turtles, and Patrick/Spongebob, which are also turtles, are within close proximity. If they are, the corresponding character loses a life. The first person to lose all of their lives loses the game.</h1></center>

		  <center><h1>My partner and I coded a Scratch game that displayed the life of one of our classmates at our school. We created a procedure for the animation of the sprite movement, we animated her walking between classes, we used multiple backgrounds to indicate the setting, we coded in user input to determine where she moves, we added background music for the sound, and we added an invisible counter to determine whether the character is allowed to be in a certain area or not.</h1></center>
