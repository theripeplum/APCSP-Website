		  <center><h1>My partner and I decided to make a pizza maker. We added choices for toppings that people can use. If there is a certain topping that you don't like, you can always choose "no." The worker is a bit sassy, though, so if you say anything other than yes or no, he may give you lip. Overall, it's a python recreation of everyone's favorite food: pizza.</h1></center>

		  <center><h1>My partners and I decided to make an interactive two player game. In this game, Spongebob and Patrick are able to shoot fireballs. This code detects for when fireballs, which are turtles, and Patrick/Spongebob, which are also turtles, are within close proximity. If they are, the corresponding character loses a life. The first person to lose all of their lives loses the game.</h1></center>

		  <center><h1>My partner and I coded a Scratch game that displayed the life of one of our classmates at our school. We created a procedure for the animation of the sprite movement, we animated her walking between classes, we used multiple backgrounds to indicate the setting, we coded in user input to determine where she moves, we added background music for the sound, and we added an invisible counter to determine whether the character is allowed to be in a certain area or not.</h1></center>

		  <center><h1>Desert Plains</h1></center>

		  <center><h1>We have concluded that Desert Plains is the correct biome because all of the data fits almost exactly between the two. With temperature that rises quickly between what is probably night and day time. The biggest discrepancy is the sound levels which are always moving up and down, which makes sense because they are chirping, but an almost 80 db average is quite loud, but it is an alien planet so the creatures could be quite loud. The wind movement or pressure also fits because the rover is probably moving around, so if it turns around then the wind speed would be inverted, and the wind is always blowing though and this matches up with the winds which are constant and vary with regularity which makes sense.</h1></center>

		  <center><h1>One of the biggest challenges of processing the data is that a lot of the data has been adjusted for readability. For example, a lot of the numbers have commas every three digits in order for the reader to accurately determine what the number is. We had to adjust the code and make it so that the commas could disappear, and that N/A values would also disappear. Data visualization was able to put into perspective the state of bee colonies in the US. It helped us to see trends and thus allowed us to recognize where outliers were and where problems arose. </h1></center>

		  <center><h1>My partner and I made a slideshow depicting a NetLogo simulation of honeybees and their production of honey. The slideshow goes over our initial thought of the simulation, some potential variables that the simulation doesn't take into account, ways that we would try to recreate the simulation in order to be more accurate, and practical uses for the simulation.</h1></center>
